This is a basic implementation of an FMNA (ForgetMeNotAfrica) eTXT client in 
for Django on Google App Engine (django-nonrel).

I have intentionally excluded django-nonrel files from this repo, in order to 
minimize repo size and to avoid having to pull in updates from upstream. In 
order to get this project running: 
1) Clone/download. Assumption is you have GAE SDK configured already
2) follow instructions at [insert URL] so that the following django-nonrel
 folders/symlinks are in the app folder: search, permission-backend_nonrel,
 djangotoolbox, djangoappengine, dbindexer and autoload
3) rename example-app.yaml to app.yaml & set details relevant for your app

The default endpoint URL is http://yourapp.appspot.com/api/ProcessEtxtRequest - you can change this in urls.py. The example action
 is to echo the message recieved
